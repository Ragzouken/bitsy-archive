You found a nice warm cup of tea. Happy unbirthday to you!

"""
March Hare: You enjoyed our singing? You must have a cup of tea! Come on! Don't be shy! Today is your unbirthday too! Sing with us! 
Alice in Wonderland, how do you get to Wonderland?
Over the hill or underland, or just behind the tree?
When clouds go rolling by, they roll away and leave the sky.
Where is the land beyond the eye, that people can not see, where can it be?
Where do stars go, where is the crescent moon?
They must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon.
Alice in Wonderland, where is the path to Wonderland?
Over the hill or here or there, I wonder where.
