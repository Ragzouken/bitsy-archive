{sequence
  - Thank you for coming. I needed to get something off of my chest. Please stay a while and listen.
  - When I was younger, a teenager, I had four friends.
  - It was a long time ago.
  - Aaron, Rob, Sam, and Christian.
  - Aaron was the skateboarder kid, but he had other talents.
  - Aaron could play the guitar really quite well. Girls loved him.
  - He, Rob, Sam, and I would sit at the park and he would play.
  - Sam could play guitar as well, but not quite as well.
  - Sam had... {shk}difficulties{shk} in his life.
  - Socializing didn't come easy to Sam, and when it came to guitar he would be somewhat competitive.
  - We would goad him on. It was funny when Sam would get mad.
  - He would kick the floor and make loud grunts.
  - Sam was really small, skeleton-thin. Nobody was afraid of him.
  - We would laugh at his frustration, but we were still his friends.
  - One day, we all went to the school after sundown.
  - We had decided to play paintball on school grounds.
  - That was where I met Christian, a friend of Rob's.
  - We ran around the school for hours, until 3 in the morning.
  - We had to leave, but we couldn't find Sam.
  - The sun was coming up when he popped out of a garbage can.
  - He riddled us with paintballs and proclaimed himself "Ninja master."
  - We were all pretty pissed, but Rob was furious.
  - Rob stomped on Sam's skateboard, snapping it in half.
  - Rob is this big Irish guy, always liked to drink and pick fights.
  - This was different, though. Rob wasn't play mad- this was real.
  - Sam tried to pick a fight with Rob and Rob broke his nose.
  - We found out later that Sam was on meth that night.
  - It's weird, none of us talked to him about it.
  - We just treated it like it was an adult decision to {wvy}do meth{wvy}.
  - We were only 16 years old and we just thought he was being stupid.
  - Stupid Sam. Typical Sam.
  - I didn't talk to Sam for a while after that.
  - I spent most of my time with Aaron. He was my closest friend.
  - We would spend nights at a time playing Medal of Honor at his place.
  - I helped to build him a computer and we would play Counter-Strike.
  - Those were care-free days.
  - At some point I started being more withdrawn.
  - You see, I always saw myself as this artist.
  - I would write poetry, paint portraits, yadda yadda.
  - I thought that, in order to survive as an artist, I needed to be a hermit.
  - Cast everyone out of your life, and then become {wvy}artist supreme.{wvy}
  - This lasted for a couple years until I got my first real girlfriend.
  - You don't need to know much about her, but it didn't last long.
  - I had been so withdrawn, and felt wanted for the first time.
  - I kinda cracked, and turned to Aaron to get my mind off of things.
  - We were in our late teens now, and I started drinking really heavily.
  - I realized how bad it had gotten, but felt that I {shk}needed it.{shk}
  - I would drink half of a bottle of whiskey a day before noon.
  - Aaron saw this and got me into weed to get me away from alcohol.
  - During this time I got reconnected with Rob and Christian.
  - Rob hadn't changed at all, but I got to know Christian better.
  - He was younger than us by a couple years.
  - He would always ask questions. Really energetic.
  - Aaron was annoyed by him, but I found his search for knowledge inspiring.
  - I had been taking classes at the community college so I would relay whatever info I could to Christian.
  - He soaked it up like a sponge.
  - Christian was from the really, really bad side of town.
  - The side of town where everybody sells pills, takes pills, or both.
  - He would ask to borrow money from me and pay me back in double.
  - He was pushing {shk}Vicodin and Adderall{shk} and I was his investor.
  - I tried to teach him some of the stuff I knew about computers.
  - He would catch on so fast, I figured he had a future in it.
  - One day he totally fell off the map. His parents kicked him out.
  - Turns out he was going out with this girl that they didn't like.
  - The girl Christian was going out with was from a certain family.
  - Her family was really well known for being deep in {shk}shit{shk}.
  - {shk}Shit{shk} is what we called meth.
  - That made methheads {shk}"shitheads."{shk}
  - He and she were homeless after that, and hard to keep track of.
  - I started thinking about the future, but Aaron and Rob didn't.
  - They seemed totally content with smoking pot all day long.
  - We were in our early twenties now. This couldn't be our lives forever.
  - I quit smoking pot, got my act together, and got a job.
  - Around this time, Sam started trying to reconnect with me.
  - Sam had gone in and out of the military since we last spoke.
  - He hadn't done meth since I last spoke to him...
  - ...but he sounded more paranoid than ever.
  - He unloaded onto me all of the shit he had gone through.
  - His step-dad beat him routinely, his mother didn't care.
  - He tried every drug under the sun to cope.
  - He was so skinny because he never ate, trying to disappear.
  - He had attempted suicide multiple times by overdose.
  - Now he was a changed man, he assured me.
  - He had his own place, had stable work, had his own truck.
  - It didn't take long for that paint to peel though.
  - He would ramble on and on about the {wvy}afterlife{wvy}.
  - He said he would have {wvy}72 wives in a big mansion{wvy}.
  - {wvy}There would be a room in that mansion just for me{wvy}.
  - {wvy}So he could come and talk to me and I could read to his wives{wvy}.
  - Again, I don't know how this didn't set off red flags.
  - My friend was showing every sign of being mentally unhinged, but I didn't react at all.
  - Maybe I was just too caught up in my own shit. Maybe I already figured Sam was doomed to insanity.
  - Things got worse, though.
  - Every other week he would tell me about a new diet he found online.
  - First it was a strict mushroom diet.
  - Then it was bread and vinegar.
  - Then he insisted that hydration was a myth and {shk}stopped drinking water{shk}.
  - This is a guy who jogged at least {shk}10 miles a day{shk}.
  - Eventually it reached its natural conclusion: he {shk}stopped eating{shk}.
  - He would walk around wheezing, insisting that air sustained him.
  - He would eat three olives every five days. Said it was all he needed.
  - Aaron was talking to Sam at this point as well.
  - Unlike me, Aaron would ridicule Sam for these ridiculous diets.
  - Sam insisted that he was on a {wvy}higher level of understanding{wvy}.
  - We weren't {wvy}enlightened enough to understand his ways{wvy}.
  - One night Sam began sending me text messages.
  - He was away from home and hyperventilating.
  - He said that he was positive that {wvy}somebody was trying to murder him{wvy}.
  - As the conversation drew on I realized that he was having a nervous breakdown.
  - Sam was at boot camp for retraining and insisted the other soldiers {shk}wanted to kill him{shk}.
  - I tried to calm him down for hours but he was talking in circles.
  - Eventually I cracked and told him to {shk}shut up{shk}.
  - Sam never spoke to me again.
  - By this point I was spending most of my time with Aaron.
  - Rob had driven across the country to connect with some of his family.
  - Aaron was spending a lot of his time on that side of town Christian came from.
  - Aaron was a smart kid, was in honors classes, but couldn't find work.
  - I blamed it on his constantly being high, but I think it was more than that.
  - I think he never mentally left high school and sabotaged himself.
  - Getting work meant that he was a {shk}grown up{shk}.
  - Meant those simple times we played Counter-Strike were {shk}over{shk}.
  - He started getting withdrawn and seemed constantly tired.
  - He would take lots of naps and was constantly borrowing money.
  - I didn't really have many friends left at this point, so I stuck by him.
  - I even tried to get Aaron jobs every now and then.
  - My girlfriend at the time was not a fan of Aaron.
  - She thought he was on hard drugs and was taking advantage of me.
  - She was right.
  - One day I caught Aaron stealing from me.
  - I learned he had been stealing from me for months.
  - Hundreds of dollars.
  - I tried to get him to come clean, gave him every out.
  - He denied it up and down.
  - There was video proof of him stealing from me.
  - I filed a report with the police.
  - Aaron didn't dispute it at that point.
  - He tried a different lie: that he needed the money for detox meds.
  - I asked around and everybody confirmed that he was on opiates.
  - He wasn't detoxing, and I wasn't the only person he was stealing from.
  - Ten years of friendship ended.
  - {shk}I didn't talk to Aaron ever again.{shk}
  - It was just my girlfriend and me for years after that.
  - I didn't have any friends. I stopped trusting people.
  - One day, in my late 20's, I met up with Rob again.
  - Rob was working as a salesman, good dignified work.
  - He asked why I wasn't at Christian's wake.
  - {shk}I didn't even know Christian had died.{shk}
  - He was selling heroine by the park and got jumped.
  - He was beaten to death and left on the train tracks.
  - The obituary read as an {wvy}accident{wvy}.
  - {shk}He was only 22 years old.{shk}
  - He was dead for so long and nobody told me.
  - Christian's meth addict girlfriend became a born-again.
  - She still posts every day on social media about how {wvy}Christian watches down on her from heaven.{wvy}
  - He was so smart. So much potential. So much energy.
  - {shk}So much life to live.{shk}
  - Rob also told me that he had been in contact with Aaron.
  - Aaron moved out of state after I filed the report on him.
  - He seemed to clean up his act, but every now and then he returns.
  - When Aaron returns he falls right back into the same habits.
  - He told people that I was a paranoid nut who falsely accused him.
  - I would be mad, but everybody knew better.
  - They had all caught Aaron stealing from them too.
  - Rob moved away a couple months later. {clr2}I'm alone now.{clr2}
  - I work so often that I can't even paint or write poetry.
  - I don't know if I even want to.
  - Life is... weird, you know?
  - Perhaps Sam was always doomed to insanity.
  - Christian seemed to have so much potential but made the wrong choices.
  - Aaron was smart, talented, charming, but wasted it all.
  - Rob was a dumb, angry drunk who got his shit together.
  - I'm a neurotic, emotionally unstable artist. Why didn't I break down?
  - Why didn't I get killed on the street?
  - Why didn't I become an addict and compulsive liar?
  - Why am I here and Aaron, Sam, and Christian aren't?
  - Can I really say that I made it?
  - I spent so many years trying to hone a craft.
  - I spent so many years trying to be a responsible adult.
  - Now all that I want is to go back in time.
  - Aaron betrayed me but I want to play Medal of Honor with him again.
  - Sam lost his mind but I want to hear him play guitar against Aaron again.
  - Rob is a busy salesman but I want to have too many drinks with him again.
  - Christian... {shk}fuck, I just don't want for Christian to be dead.{shk}
  - But I'm stuck here, like a nightmare of quicksand.
  - I know where I want to go but it just keeps getting farther away.
  - Those times when we would just kick back and waste time...
  - ...back when we had time to waste...
  - ...
  - {shk}...{shk}
  - I'll never be able to go back.
  - Back then everything felt okay. Things didn't feel like this.
  - I didn't feel alone. I didn't feel hopeless.
  - All I have to look forward to is a TV dinner and another day at work.
  - At work all I have to look forward to is going home.
  - One day I'll be too old to keep working at the factory.
  - I barely make enough money to make rent, I don't have any savings.
  - No other job will call me back.
  - I'm not just stuck moving forward in life, I'm stuck moving forward in {shk}THIS life.{shk}
  - Then one day things won't be able to go on. So they won't.
  - ...
  - There were a lot of opportunities to change things.
  - Don't feel bad for me. I know that this is my fault.
  - I'll live with this now. Or I won't. It's okay.
  - Things don't need to be so dramatic.
  - Perhaps I'll adopt a pseudo-philosophical view of my life.
  - I'll say that my old life lives on in my memories.
  - Aaron with his innocence, Sam with his mind, Christian with his life.
  - All alive in my memories.
  - ...hey, thanks for listening. Is it okay if I tell one more story?
  - A few years ago I was driving to work.
  - On the freeway, no more than five cars ahead of me, a girl walked out.
  - She was hit and killed immediately, caused a huge jam.
  - As we all apathetically drove by slowly to go to work, I saw her.
  - No more than 21 years old, wearing a college tee.
  - Now she was dead. Gone.
  - The woman who hit her was in hysterics.
  - This girl walked out onto the road and ended her life, ruining another.
  - Leaving the exit there was a car in front of me swerving.
  - The car ran a red light and was t-boned in the intersection.
  - The car was full of passengers.
  - I stopped my car and walked over to help.
  - The driver had exited the vehicle and sat calmly on the sidewalk.
  - I helped pull a bloodied woman out of the wreckage.
  - Her left arm was shredded. She was screaming something at me.
  - I thought it was nonsense, but then I understood her.
  - She was screaming, {shk}{wvy}"MY BABY!"{wvy}{shk}
  - Another good samaritan pulled a baby seat from the car.
  - The baby didn't look hurt, but wasn't crying.
  - In case you don't know about babies, if they're not crying, it's bad.
  - I didn't have enough time though, there was one more passenger.
  - The passenger side was smashed.
  - Inside was a woman, sobbing, incoherent.
  - She was cut almost completely in half by the folded door.
  - This woman was certainly not going to make it.
  - The man who had hit the car was okay save for a broken wrist.
  - The driver didn't say anything or move from the spot on the sidewalk.
  - I left as the fire trucks came with the jaws of life.
  - I was tense all day at work.
  - At lunch I decided to eat outside, behind the building.
  - Cold, night air. I had seen two deaths on the road, needed this.
  - Then I heard yelling.
  - Right across the street from me a fight had broken out.
  - Two guys in hoodies were yelling at each other.
  - Next thing I knew I was hearing loud {shk}bangs{shk}.
  - One of the men had shot the other {shk}five times in the chest{shk}.
  - I called 911.
  - The police didn't arrive for 45 minutes.
  - The body had been {shk}dragged away{shk}.
  - The police told me they'd look into it and drove away.
  - I had seen a {shk}suicide{shk}, an {shk}accidental death{shk}, and a {shk}murder{shk}.
  - {wvy}All in the same day.{wvy}
  - I quit the next day.
  - That was my first job.
  - I had only worked there for a month.
  - I had no idea how bad a month-long employment looks on a resume.
  - Might as well have written "{wvy}non-reliable{wvy}" under skills.
  - I'm only working where I am now because, well, they hire everybody.
  - Teenagers, the elderly, convicts, whatever.
  - If you can do labor, you can work there.
  - It's really weird. It's like being in purgatory.
  - The job is brainless, repetition for twelve hours a day.
  - But everybody there seems... hopeless.
  - It feels like they've all given up.
  - Everybody there is there to stay. Myself included.
  - We didn't make it in life, so we're re-purposed as gears for a big machine.
  - A big machine that is, slowly but surely, becoming a monopoly.
  - When I moved out and got my own place, I remember thinking.
  - I thought: {wvy}why am I the only one of my friends who grew up?{wvy}
  - Now all I think is: {shk}I wish I never grew up.{shk}
  - But that's life.
  - I have to harden up.
  - This is what life is.
  - Life is pain.
  - Life is hardship.
  - Everybody knows it.
  - Everybody deals with it.
  - Why should I just sit around acting sorry for myself.
  - What kind of bullshit is that?
  - I'm not special. I'm not better than my coworkers.
  - {wvy}Deserve{wvy} has nothing to do with it.
  - People who criticize this draining lifestyle are just whiners.
  - That's me: I'm being a {wvy}whiner{wvy}.
  - I just have to... I just have to...
  - {shk}I just have to accept that this is my life and it won't get better.{shk}
  - Every now and then I'll save up some vacation time.
  - I'll spend a couple days away from home, in another country maybe.
  - Except that I won't.
  - What am I going to do in Paris?
  - Just sit and think about work?
  - Fly to Spain and think of how much debt I'm getting into?
  - I know exactly what I'm going to do with my vacation time.
  - I'm going to sit at home and watch TV.
  - I'll be so bored that I'll miss my boring job.
  - {shk}What do I want?!{shk}
  - {shk}{wvy}I don't know what I want out of life!{wvy}{shk}
  - I don't have the time or money to date.
  - I don't have the time or money to go to school.
  - I don't have the time or money to paint.
  - I crumple up every poem I ever write.
  - I'm just... alone.
  - I think that's all I'll ever be.
  - Sam is insane, Aaron a pill popper, Christian a corpse...
  - ...and I'm alone.
  - ...
  - {shk}...{shk}
  - {shk}I can't live like this.{shk}
  - {shk}I'm not going to live like this.{shk}
  - {shk}I refuse to die an unfulfilled, lonely man.{shk}
  - {shk}My mind is in tact. I'm not an addict. I'm ALIVE.{shk}
  - I know what I have to do.
  - Thank you.

{sequence
  - Thank you for coming. I needed to get something off of my chest. Please stay a while and listen.
  - When I was younger, a teenager, I had four friends.
  - It was a long time ago.
  - Aaron, Rob, Sam, and Christian.
  - Aaron was the skateboarder kid, but he had other talents.
  - Aaron could play the guitar really quite well. Girls loved him.
  - He, Rob, Sam, and I would sit at the park and he would play.
  - Sam could play guitar as well, but not quite as well.
  - Sam had... {shk}difficulties{shk} in his life.
  - Socializing didn't come easy to Sam, and when it came to guitar he would be somewhat competitive.
  - We would goad him on. It was funny when Sam would get mad.
  - He would kick the floor and make loud grunts.
  - Sam was really small, skeleton-thin. Nobody was afraid of him.
  - We would laugh at his frustration, but we were still his friends.
  - One day, we all went to the school after sundown.
  - We had decided to play paintball on school grounds.
  - That was where I met Christian, a friend of Rob's.
  - We ran around the school for hours, until 3 in the morning.
  - We had to leave, but we couldn't find Sam.
  - The sun was coming up when he popped out of a garbage can.
  - He riddled us with paintballs and proclaimed himself "Ninja master."
  - We were all pretty pissed, but Rob was furious.
  - Rob stomped on Sam's skateboard, snapping it in half.
  - Rob is this big Irish guy, always liked to drink and pick fights.
  - This was different, though. Rob wasn't play mad- this was real.
  - Sam tried to pick a fight with Rob and Rob broke his nose.
  - We found out later that Sam was on meth that night.
  - It's weird, none of us talked to him about it.
  - We just treated it like it was an adult decision to {wvy}do meth{wvy}.
  - We were only 16 years old and we just thought he was being stupid.
  - Stupid Sam. Typical Sam.
  - I didn't talk to Sam for a while after that.
  - I spent most of my time with Aaron. He was my closest friend.
  - We would spend nights at a time playing Medal of Honor at his place.
  - I helped to build him a computer and we would play Counter-Strike.
  - Those were care-free days.
  - At some point I started being more withdrawn.
  - You see, I always saw myself as this artist.
  - I would write poetry, paint portraits, yadda yadda.
  - I thought that, in order to survive as an artist, I needed to be a hermit.
  - Cast everyone out of your life, and then become {wvy}artist supreme.{wvy}
  - This lasted for a couple years until I got my first real girlfriend.
  - You don't need to know much about her, but it didn't last long.
  - I had been so withdrawn, and felt wanted for the first time.
  - I kinda cracked, and turned to Aaron to get my mind off of things.
  - We were in our late teens now, and I started drinking really heavily.
  - I realized how bad it had gotten, but felt that I {shk}needed it.{shk}
  - I would drink half of a bottle of whiskey a day before noon.
  - Aaron saw this and got me into weed to get me away from alcohol.
  - During this time I got reconnected with Rob and Christian.
  - Rob hadn't changed at all, but I got to know Christian better.
  - He was younger than us by a couple years.
  - He would always ask questions. Really energetic.
  - Aaron was annoyed by him, but I found his search for knowledge inspiring.
  - I had been taking classes at the community college so I would relay whatever info I could to Christian.
  - He soaked it up like a sponge.
  - Christian was from the really, really bad side of town.
  - The side of town where everybody sells pills, takes pills, or both.
  - He would ask to borrow money from me and pay me back in double.
  - He was pushing {shk}Vicodin and Adderall{shk} and I was his investor.
  - I tried to teach him some of the stuff I knew about computers.
  - He would catch on so fast, I figured he had a future in it.
  - One day he totally fell off the map. His parents kicked him out.
  - Turns out he was going out with this girl that they didn't like.
  - The girl Christian was going out with was from a certain family.
  - Her family was really well known for being deep in {shk}shit{shk}.
  - {shk}Shit{shk} is what we called meth.
  - That made methheads {shk}"shitheads."{shk}
  - He and she were homeless after that, and hard to keep track of.
  - I started thinking about the future, but Aaron and Rob didn't.
  - They seemed totally content with smoking pot all day long.
  - We were in our early twenties now. This couldn't be our lives forever.
  - I quit smoking pot, got my act together, and got a job.
  - Around this time, Sam started trying to reconnect with me.
  - Sam had gone in and out of the military since we last spoke.
  - He hadn't done meth since I last spoke to him...
  - ...but he sounded more paranoid than ever.
  - He unloaded onto me all of the shit he had gone through.
  - His step-dad beat him routinely, his mother didn't care.
  - He tried every drug under the sun to cope.
  - He was so skinny because he never ate, trying to disappear.
  - He had attempted suicide multiple times by overdose.
  - Now he was a changed man, he assured me.
  - He had his own place, had stable work, had his own truck.
  - It didn't take long for that paint to peel though.
  - He would ramble on and on about the {wvy}afterlife{wvy}.
  - He said he would have {wvy}72 wives in a big mansion{wvy}.
  - {wvy}There would be a room in that mansion just for me{wvy}.
  - {wvy}So he could come and talk to me and I could read to his wives{wvy}.
  - Again, I don't know how this didn't set off red flags.
  - My friend was showing every sign of being mentally unhinged, but I didn't react at all.
  - Maybe I was just too caught up in my own shit. Maybe I already figured Sam was doomed to insanity.
  - Things got worse, though.
  - Every other week he would tell me about a new diet he found online.
  - First it was a strict mushroom diet.
  - Then it was bread and vinegar.
  - Then he insisted that hydration was a myth and {shk}stopped drinking water{shk}.
  - This is a guy who jogged at least {shk}10 miles a day{shk}.
  - Eventually it reached its natural conclusion: he {shk}stopped eating{shk}.
  - He would walk around wheezing, insisting that air sustained him.
  - He would eat three olives every five days. Said it was all he needed.
  - Aaron was talking to Sam at this point as well.
  - Unlike me, Aaron would ridicule Sam for these ridiculous diets.

  - {wvy}All in the same day.{wvy}
  - I quit the next day.
  - That was my first job.
  - I had only worked there for a month.
  - I had no idea how bad a month-long employment looks on a resume.
  - Might as well have written "{wvy}non-reliable{wvy}" under skills.
  - I'm only working where I am now because, well, they hire everybody.
  - Teenagers, the elderly, convicts, whatever.
  - If you can do labor, you can work there.
  - It's really weird. It's like being in purgatory.
  - The job is brainless, repetition for twelve hours a day.
  - But everybody there seems... hopeless.
  - It feels like they've all given up.
  - Everybody there is there to stay. Myself included.
  - We didn't make it in life, so we're re-purposed as gears for a big machine.
  - A big machine that is, slowly but surely, becoming a monopoly.
  - When I moved out and got my own place, I remember thinking.
  - I thought: {wvy}why am I the only one of my friends who grew up?{wvy}
  - Now all I think is: {shk}I wish I never grew up.{shk}
  - But that's life.
  - I have to harden up.
  - This is what life is.
  - Life is pain.
  - Life is hardship.
  - Everybody knows it.
  - Everybody deals with it.
  - Why should I just sit around acting sorry for myself.
  - What kind of bullshit is that?
  - I'm not special. I'm not better than my coworkers.
  - {wvy}Deserve{wvy} has nothing to do with it.
  - People who criticize this draining lifestyle are just whiners.
  - That's me: I'm being a {wvy}whiner{wvy}.
  - I just have to... I just have to...
  - {shk}I just have to accept that this is my life and it won't get better.{shk}
  - Every now and then I'll save up some vacation time.
  - I'll spend a couple days away from home, in another country maybe.
  - Except that I won't.
  - What am I going to do in Paris?
  - Just sit and think about work?
  - Fly to Spain and think of how much debt I'm getting into?
  - I know exactly what I'm going to do with my vacation time.
  - I'm going to sit at home and watch TV.
  - I'll be so bored that I'll miss my boring job.
  - {shk}What do I want?!{shk}
  - {shk}{wvy}I don't know what I want out of life!{wvy}{shk}
  - I don't have the time or money to date.
  - I don't have the time or money to go to school.
  - I don't have the time or money to paint.
  - I crumple up every poem I ever write.
  - I'm just... alone.
  - I think that's all I'll ever be.
  - Sam is insane, Aaron a pill popper, Christian a corpse...
  - ...and I'm alone.
  - ...
  - {shk}...{shk}
  - {shk}I can't live like this.{shk}
  - {shk}I'm not going to live like this.{shk}
  - {shk}I refuse to die an unfulfilled, lonely man.{shk}
  - {shk}My mind is in tact. I'm not an addict. I'm ALIVE.{shk}
  - I know what I have to do.
  - Thank you.
