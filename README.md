# bitsy boutique & inclusion in this archive
1. i probably already have you listed in my [Bitsy Omnibus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBUgCYOnMJ9REHuZdTodc6Ft2Vs6JXbH4K-bIgL9TPc/edit?usp=sharing), do i have the listed author credit correct or would you prefer something else?
2. could i have permission to include your games as part of the library when exhibiting my hardware bitsy player [Bitsy Boutique](https://candle.itch.io/bitsy-boutique)?
3. could i have permission to include your games' gamedata as part of this public archive of bitsy games?
